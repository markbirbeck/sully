EXPOSE 9229

# Create and set the working directory for the unit under test:
#
WORKDIR /usr/src/uut

# Install Dockerode:
#
# Note that modules are installed globally so that they don't
# interfere with the Node modules directory used for the
# UUT, allowing a volume to be mapped in for that:
#
ENV NODE_PATH /usr/local/lib/node_modules

RUN npm install -g \
  dockerode

# Install Blessed:
#
ENV LANG=en_US.utf8 TERM=xterm-256color

RUN npm install -g \
  blessed \
  colors

# Install chokidar:
#
RUN npm install -g \
  chokidar

COPY *.js /usr/src/sully/

# Basic behaviour is to run Sully:
#
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "/usr/src/sully/index.js"]
